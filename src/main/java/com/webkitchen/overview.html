Brainathlon is a neurofeedback game where players compete in brainwave
mastery.  Each game consists of 3 courses (mini-games) which can be configured to reward
activity in different frequency bands.  The game can be played alone, or two players can compete
against each other to determine who is really the master of their own mind.
<p/>
Brainathlon is created to work with the ModEEG device developed by the
<a href="http://openeeg.sourceforge.net">OpenEEG</a> open source project
